Operator is a symbol that performs an action on the given operands.
Operand is the variable or value on which the operation is done.
	Ex: x+10	here x and 10 are operands,  + is the operator

Operators are of 2 types :
--> Unary operator
--> Binary operator

Unary operator:
The operator that has only one operand is called unary operator
Ex:	& (used in scanf)  !  ++  --

Binary operator
The operator that has two operands is called binary operator
Ex:	+  -   *   /  =   >   <  ==

Types of operators :
-->  Arithmetic Operators
-->  Relational Operators
-->  Logical Operators
-->  Assignment Operators
-->  Ternary/Conditional Operators
-->  Increment and Decrement Operators
-->  Bitwise Operators
-->  Pointer Operators
-->  Special Operators

Arithmetic Operators	+	-	*	/	%
	+	addition
	-	subtraction
	*	multiplication
	/	division (integer and float division)
	%	mod operator (to calculate the remainder of an integer division)

Relational Operators	>	<	==	>=	<=	!=
	>	greater than
	<	lesser than
	==	equal to
	>=	greater than or equal to
	<=	lesser than or equal to
	!=	not equal to
	These operators are used to perform comparision between values/variables
	The result of a comparision is always true or false
	true is represented with 1   (also any non 0 value is assumed as true)
	false is represented with 0

-->  Logical Operators		&&	||	!
	&&	logical 'and'
	||	logical 'or'
	!	logical 'not'
	They are used to combine more than comparisions in a single expression
	The result of these operators is true(1) or false(0)
	
	Truth table for &&(and) operator
	cond1	cond2	cond1 && cond2
	  F	  F		F
	  F	  T		F
	  T	  F		F
	  T	  T		T

	Truth table for ||(or) operator
	cond1	cond2	cond1 || cond2
	  F	  F		F
	  F	  T		T
	  T	  F		T
	  T	  T		T

	Truth table for !(not) operator
	cond	!cond
	  F	  T
	  T	  F

  Assignment Operators:
the operaters are same like arthematic operators but there will be equalto(=) after the arthematic operators.
==
+=
-=
*=
/=
%=
Ex:if x=2
x=x+3 can be written as x+=3
x=x-3 can be written as x-=3
and remaining can also be written like this.                                       


Ternary/Conditional Operators:
conditional operators are ?,: .
syntax:   
 	Condition ? expression1 : expression2
If condition is true then it redirects to expression-1
If condition is false then it redirects to expression-2.
