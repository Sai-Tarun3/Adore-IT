Program : A program is a set of instructions.
These set of instructions give the procedure of performing a task on the computer

Programming is done by using programming languages

C, C++, Java programs	<---conversion--->	Binary Language (0 or 1)

			Programming Languages
			/		    \
		High Level Languages    Low Level Languages
		(user understandable)   (machine understandable)
		C, C++, Java, C#, J#	 Binary/Machine language
		VC++, PHP, Python, HTML	  Ada Lang, Assembly lang.
		SQL, XML, R-Lang, Ruby

A high level language program (user understandable) is called "Source Code"
A low level language program (machine understandable) is called "Object Code"

Language Processors:
They are the software used to convert a user written program (source code) into the manchine understandable code (object code).
These language processors are:
-->Interpretters
-->Compilers
-->Assemblers

Working of an Interpretter
--> It reads only one line at a time
--> verify the accuracy of that statement
--> if no errors, then it gives the output of that statement and repeat from step1
--> as there is no object stored, to see the output we need re-interprettation

Working of an Compiler
--> It reads all lines of the program
--> verify the accuracy of the entire program an list out errors if any
--> if no errors, then it creates an object code and stores it
--> this object code can be re-used any number of times to see the output.

Assembler
- it is a software used only for assembly language programs
  Assembly language is NOT a completely low level language, so we need a conversion on this.
  This conversion is done by Assembler

Compilers and interpretters are different for every programming language

History of programming languages
--------------------------------
- Initially only Binary language was used to give input

- Concept of programming started using a language called ADA 
  It is developed on the name of Lady Lovelace Ada (1st programming lang)

- ForTran (Formula Translation) is the first HLL by IBM (international Business Machines) 
   in the year 1957. It is mathametical oriented language

- COBOL (Common Business Oriented Language) by CODASYL in 1959-60. It is a Business purpose language

- BASIC (Beginners Allpurpose Symbolic Instruction Code) in 1964
  by John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz. It is a Beginner's Language

- Pascal by Nicolaus Writh in 1965 on the name of Blaise Pascal
  Scientific language used for research and development

people from all over the world were called and a research was conducted to develop
  a language that will serve all requirements
- BCPL Basic Combined Programming Language
- B-Language
- C-Language developed in 1970 by Dennis Ritchie at AT&T (American Telegraphs and Telecommunications) CA, USA

There is a famous saying about the C language.
	'C' is a 'Sea'
