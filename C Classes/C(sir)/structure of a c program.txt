Structure of a C program
------------------------
/* comment lines */
// single line comment
#define <constants>
#include <header files>
global variables
void main()
{
   local variables
   ..................
   ..................
     I/O statements
   ..................
   ..................
}
user defined function()
{
   ..................
      statements
   ..................
}

Comment : 
It is the meaning or description of a statement or a block of code.
Comments are skipped by the compiler. It is only for readers of the program.
We can write comments at any part of the program
comments can be single line or multiple line
// single line comment
/*  multiple line comment */

Constants:
They are fixed values that are represented with a name and cannot be changed in the process of a program.
Syntax:   #define name <value>
    Ex:   #define PI 3.14
	  #define A 7473

Header files :
It is called as a library file in which we have pre-defined 
-functions, 
-constants, 
-datatypes and 
-global variables
When we include a header file into a program, all contents of that header file can be used in that program
#include <header file name>
Ex: #include <stdio.h>
    #include <conio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <ctype.h>
    #include <bios.h>
    #include <dos.h>
    #include <string.h>
    #include <math.h>
There are many header files pre-installed with the software. 
We can also create our own header files

Variables :
A variable is a name that represents a value and it can be changed in the program.
Variables hold values of different types (we call them as datatypes)

			  Datatypes in C
			     	|
		---------------------------------
		|				|
	    Basic datatypes		Derived datatypes
		int (2)			long int(4), short int(2), unsigned int(2)
		float (4)		double(8), long double(10)
		char (1)

int 	: +/- values without decimal point
	  Ex:   -2     2     0
float	: +/- values with decimal point
	  Ex:   2.5   -2.5   0.0    2.0
char	: any one alphabet or symbol or digit given within ' ' single quotes
	  Ex:  'a'   '+'   '6'

Before using a variable in the program we have to declare it.
	Datatype <variables>;
	int rno, sno, age, no_of_students, marks;
	float height, weight, cost, avg;
	char grade, section, gender;
	
If the variable is declared before main(), it is called global variable.
A global variable scope is in the entire program.

If the variable is declared inside main() block or inside any function block, it is called local variable.
A local variable scope is limited to the block in which it is declared


main()
It is a compulsory function for every C program
() indicates that it is a function
A program must contain main()
Object code cannot be created if main() function is not given

I/O statements
Input and output statements are used to accept values from user and display values to the user
